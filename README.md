# clarkemoyer.com

A modern personal website built with Next.js, migrated from WordPress to provide better performance, maintainability, and developer experience.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete refactoring of Clarke Moyer's personal website from WordPress to Next.js. The project demonstrates a successful migration strategy that preserves all original content while modernizing the technology stack for better performance and maintenance.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **Content**: Markdown with Gray Matter frontmatter
- **Deployment**: Static site generation to GitHub Pages
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

### Migration Approach

The migration from WordPress to Next.js followed a systematic approach:

1. **Content Extraction**: All WordPress content was extracted and preserved in `content/wordpress-legacy/`
2. **Content Conversion**: HTML content was converted to Markdown for better maintainability
3. **Architecture Modernization**: Rebuilt using modern React patterns and TypeScript
4. **Static Generation**: Configured for optimal performance with static site generation
5. **Deployment Automation**: Set up automated deployment to GitHub Pages
6. **Visual Enhancement**: Added professional images and improved responsive design

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/clarkemoyer/clarkemoyer.com.git
cd clarkemoyer.com

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build    # Build for production and export static files
npm run start    # Start production server (for testing build locally)
npm run lint     # Run ESLint for code quality checks
npm run test:images  # Validate image paths for local development
npm run test:images:github  # Validate image paths for GitHub Pages deployment
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Automatic Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

- **Trigger**: Every push to the `main` branch
- **Process**: Build → Static Export → Deploy to GitHub Pages
- **URL**: https://staging.clarkemoyer.com (Custom Domain)

### GitHub Pages Setup

To enable GitHub Pages deployment:

1. Go to repository **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
3. Under **Custom domain**, enter `staging.clarkemoyer.com`
4. The deployment workflow will run automatically on the next push

### Custom Domain Deployment

⚠️ **Important**: GitHub Pages only allows ONE custom domain per repository. This repository is currently configured for:
- **Custom Domain**: `staging.clarkemoyer.com`
- **Build Mode**: WITHOUT `USE_BASE_PATH` (assets load from root path)

#### Current Configuration
The site is deployed to `https://staging.clarkemoyer.com`:
- Build **without** `USE_BASE_PATH` environment variable
- All assets load from the root path (e.g., `/images/photo.jpg`)
- CNAME file in `public` directory contains `staging.clarkemoyer.com`
- Configured automatically in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

#### Alternative: GitHub Pages Subdirectory Mode
If you need to deploy to `https://clarkemoyer.github.io/clarkemoyer.com/` instead:
1. Remove the custom domain from GitHub Pages settings
2. Delete `public/CNAME` file
3. Update workflows to build with `USE_BASE_PATH=true`
4. All assets will include the `/clarkemoyer.com` basePath

```bash
# Build for custom domain (current configuration)
npm run build

# Build for GitHub Pages subdirectory (alternative)
USE_BASE_PATH=true npm run build
```

### Manual Deployment

For manual deployment or testing:

```bash
# Build the static site
npm run build

# The static files will be in the `out` directory
# These can be deployed to any static hosting service
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Image Path Validation

The project includes automated testing to ensure all images load correctly on GitHub Pages:

```bash
# Test image paths for GitHub Pages deployment
npm run test:images:github

# Test image paths for local development
npm run test:images
```

The image validation test is automatically run in the CI/CD pipeline to prevent broken images from reaching the live site. See [docs/IMAGE_TESTING.md](docs/IMAGE_TESTING.md) for detailed information.

### Development Testing
- `npm run dev` for hot reload development
- `npm run build` to test production build
- `npm run lint` for code quality

## 📋 Content Management

Content is managed through Markdown files in the `content/sections/` directory:

- Each page has a corresponding `.md` file (e.g., `about.md`, `resume.md`)
- Content supports frontmatter for metadata
- Markdown is processed and converted to HTML at build time
- Legacy WordPress content is preserved in `content/wordpress-legacy/`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Next.js Configuration

The project is configured for static site generation with flexible deployment options:

```javascript
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',        // Enable static export
  trailingSlash: true,     // Required for GitHub Pages
  images: { unoptimized: true }, // Optimize for static hosting
  // Deployment mode controlled by USE_BASE_PATH environment variable:
  // - USE_BASE_PATH=true: GitHub Pages subdirectory (clarkemoyer.github.io/clarkemoyer.com)
  // - USE_BASE_PATH unset/false: Custom domain (staging.clarkemoyer.com, clarkemoyer.com)
  basePath: process.env.USE_BASE_PATH === 'true' ? '/clarkemoyer.com' : '',
  assetPrefix: process.env.USE_BASE_PATH === 'true' ? '/clarkemoyer.com' : '',
};
```

**Key Features**:
- **Dual Deployment Mode**: Supports both GitHub Pages subdirectory and custom domain deployments
- **Environment-Based Configuration**: Use `USE_BASE_PATH` to control asset path handling
- **GitHub Pages Compatible**: Proper basePath handling for subdirectory deployments
- **Custom Domain Ready**: Assets load from root when deployed to custom domains

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is configured for optimal performance:
- Purging unused styles in production
- Custom color scheme and typography
- Responsive design utilities
