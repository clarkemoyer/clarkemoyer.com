# ✅ STAGING CUSTOM DOMAIN DEPLOYMENT - FIXED

## What Was Fixed

The site at `staging.clarkemoyer.com` was showing broken images and assets because the build configuration was incorrect for custom domain deployment.

**The Problem:** Assets were being built with `/clarkemoyer.com/` path prefix (for subdirectory deployment) but deployed to a custom domain (which uses root paths).

**The Solution:** Updated build configuration to remove the path prefix and added CNAME file.

## Changes Summary

### 1. Workflow Files Updated
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Changed `USE_BASE_PATH: true` → `USE_BASE_PATH: false`
- `.github/workflows/nextjs.yml` - Changed `USE_BASE_PATH: true` → `USE_BASE_PATH: false`

### 2. CNAME File Added
- `public/CNAME` - Contains `staging.clarkemoyer.com`
- This file tells GitHub Pages which custom domain to use

### 3. Documentation Updated
- `README.md` - Deployment section clarified
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed technical summary
- `VISUAL_FIX_EXPLANATION.md` - Visual diagrams of the fix

## What Happens After Merge

1. **Automatic Deployment**
   - Code merged to `main` branch
   - GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically
   - Site builds with correct configuration
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages

2. **Site Will Be Available At**
   - URL: `https://staging.clarkemoyer.com`
   - All images will load correctly
   - Background image (Grand Canyon family photo) will display
   - All logos and assets will work

3. **No More 404 Errors**
   - Assets will load from correct paths
   - Browser will request: `staging.clarkemoyer.com/images/photo.jpg`
   - Not: `staging.clarkemoyer.com/clarkemoyer.com/images/photo.jpg` ❌

## Verification Steps

After the PR is merged and deployed, verify the fix by:

1. **Visit the Site**
   ```
   https://staging.clarkemoyer.com
   ```

2. **Check Hero Image**
   - Should see Grand Canyon family photo as background
   - Not a broken image or blank space

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Should see NO 404 errors for images

4. **Check Network Tab**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Filter by "Img"
   - All image requests should be 200 OK
   - All image URLs should NOT include `/clarkemoyer.com/` prefix

## Build Verification (Already Done)

All local testing has been completed successfully:

```bash
✅ npm run build      - Success (12 pages generated)
✅ npm run lint       - No errors
✅ npm run test:images - 9/9 images valid
✅ CNAME file         - Present in output
✅ Asset paths        - Correct (no prefix)
```

## Important Notes

### GitHub Pages Limitation
GitHub Pages only allows **ONE custom domain per repository**. This repository is now configured for:
- **Domain:** `staging.clarkemoyer.com`
- **Mode:** Custom Domain (root paths)

If you later need to deploy to the subdirectory (`clarkemoyer.github.io/clarkemoyer.com`) instead:
1. Remove custom domain from GitHub Pages settings
2. Delete `public/CNAME` file
3. Update workflows to use `USE_BASE_PATH: true`
4. See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions

### DNS Configuration
Make sure DNS is configured correctly:
```
CNAME staging.clarkemoyer.com -> clarkemoyer.github.io
```

This should already be set up if the domain is working in GitHub Pages settings.
