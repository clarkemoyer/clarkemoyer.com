title: PSU-ARL Employee Referral Program
---

Please connect with me for referrals to work for PSU-ARL. NOTE: I provide referrals only to those that I have personally validated the experience of.

The best way to start a referral with me is to connect on Linkedin and then send me a Linkedin message. Priority is given for those that are a MOS 33W or 35T qualified and those that are currently enrolled in WGU or have completed a WGU program of study.

As ARL PI/PM I am currently hiring in multiple labor categories and locations. There is a specific focus on DevSecOps, CI/CD, Cyber security, and Logistics in the San Diego area.  You can directly apply for these jobs on the PSU-ARL Careers page without a referral.
