## BLUF: To pass the CISSP do 4 things

1. Create a contest publicly with another person to complete your CISSP before they complete a similar or identical educational objective

Note I lost this ‘race’ by one day but both of us still passed so it is a win

Buy your vouchers and a training plan at the lowest cost possible from a source that will give your test voucher and a re-take.

Take a ton of practice tests from as many sources as your access or funding allows
1. ISC Official Online, Army Skillport

Don’t over study and test as soon as you’re over the 80% pass percentage in the official tests
1. This is why you have a re-take so you don’t over study

My approach to passing the CISSP was slow and non-regimented. If you want to reduce your stress I would not follow my methods, but I did pass the first attempt and don’t think that I over studied.

TIMELINE: Each year I try and do at least one educational objective for my company performance review. I do this for several reasons.

1. I like to learn new things and believe strongly in lifelong learning for the sake of expanding one’s knowledge.
2. I like having something external to my current work to show that I am not stagnating and by extension improving my resume with industry respected factors.
3. When I do the performance reviews of others I don’t want it to come off as ‘do as I say not as I do’ when I ask for the educational objectives of others.

In most years this educational objective aligns to an industry certification.

## Books / Materials:

- Sunflower CISSP Study Guide 2.0 (Free)

Great resource. I read cover to cover and had it laminated. Best part is it is free. I also put the PDF in the kindle app on my phone but with the other apps I rarely used it this way because it is hard to read in such a small form factor.

## Training Programs:

- Ones that I took in whole or in part

CIO/G-6 NETCOM IA – Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) 2018 (Free if you hold a CAC)

- Note: If you don’t already have an account and are a contractor you must apply through your government IA rep and must be on IAT or IAM orders before they will grant you an account.

Simplilearn Online Classroom Flexi-Pass (2,319.00)
- Decent course but not as good as I wanted it to be. The videos were hard to download for offline use and still get the checkmark for completion. All in all, I would do this only so that you have a formal course to go back to and the 5 practice tests were good. This package I negotiated for an included voucher and a re-take voucher. This is worth $1,398 of the total cost so the course and tests are effectively only costing $1000 for a self paced and live video program. I would still not recommend this unless you are a very good self study person and commit to the rest of the tools. This course alone will not get it done.

Ones that I heard about but did not take
- https://portal.cyberforce.site (ISC)2 (TM) CISSP (R) Certification Prep 2018 (DISA) (Free CAC Required)

New option from DISA updated to 2018 version from FED VTE (22 Hours of Content)
- 50 question practice exam
- https://portal.cyberforce.site/content/1625/isc2-tm-cissp-r-certification-prep-2018

Syracuse NY ‘onward to opportunities’ Veterans Program
- Program for vets that gives access to the Skillport program and also includes a voucher for the test.
- Most that have taken this route don’t feel it is complete enough (skillport) but great that it includes the voucher. This course alone will not get it done.
- https://ivmf.syracuse.edu/onward-to-opportunity/

Infosec Institute CISSP Flex Basic 1 year access- Includes the voucher and 1 year of access to videos, tests, and other support materials.

- Not sold anymore publicly and included in a larger package but the vendor website is (https://www.infosecinstitute.com/courses/cissp-boot-camp/) and you can get a custom quote.
- As with all the course I am tracking, this course alone will not get it done.

## Test / Quiz options

- (ISC)² CISSP Official Study App ($10)

Bought this well before I officially started my bet and before the questions changed for 2018. In all this is a great tool for vocabulary and quick mini tests when you don’t have the time for a full 125 questions test. I would do these tests anywhere and anytime.

Official practice test book ISC2 CISSP Official Practice Tests, (2nd Edition)($25)
- I spent literally 15 hours of testing in this online portal. Best value overall. It was just released for the 2018 version and the online options for testing are the best of all the test banks that I used. I was able to take tests at the computer and on mobile with limited issues. This is a must buy for success in my mind.
