### Cooking

My wife is a trained chef but she does not have a website! This is where I keep my 'World Famous' recipes.

**Featured Recipe: Clarke Moyer's World Famous Apple Crisp**
A family favorite that combines the perfect blend of tart Granny Smith and sweet Golden Delicious apples with a crispy oat topping.

### Books & Reading

I don't read many books but when I do I sometimes add them here. I focus on books related to:
- Leadership and management
- Technology and innovation
- Business strategy
- Personal development

### Travel & Events

We love to travel and do local things. Family adventures include exploring new places, trying local cuisines, and creating lasting memories together.

### Speaking & Publishing

I occasionally speak at industry events and share knowledge through various platforms. Topics include:
- Information security best practices
- Project management methodologies
- Career development in technology
- Military to civilian transition
