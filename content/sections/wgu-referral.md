title: WGU Referral Program
---

## Absolutely free, alumni referral to Western Governors University (WGU).

For years now since I started and subsequently graduated from Western Governors University I've been referring my friends family and colleagues to enroll in the university with the WGU referral program. I have done this due to how much I enjoyed my experience as well as how much I feel that I have actually gained from the completion of my degrees. While I have attended two ground-based colleges and three different online colleges, both before and after my degrees with Western Governors University; Western Governors University is the only one who really rises to the top and deserves my undivided recommendation.

### Referral Information

### Still not convinced? Read on to see why I recommend WGU so highly

## Why an online university?

### Don't Quit Your Job
You do not have to quit your job to gain an education

### More Degree Choices
You do not have to limit yourself to the programs available in your local college

### Portability
You can move and not worry about transferring credits. With a traditional university if you move between accreditation regions some or all of your coursework will not transfer.

### Respected
If your online university holds the same accreditation as your state university it is hard to discount the quality of the program.

## Why education at all?

In a nut shell formal education has had the following effects in my life:

### Quantitative factors (actual provable results)
- More total job offers
- More stability in my position
- Improved positions
- Direct promotions

### Qualitative factors (perceived effects)
- More stability in my active position
- Transition from wage worker to career focus
- Seen as more of an expert
