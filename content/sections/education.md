title: Educational Background
---

Education has been a cornerstone of my personal and professional development. I believe in the power of continuous learning and staying current with evolving technologies and methodologies.

## My Educational Journey

I started late into education. When getting out of the Army I did not think that I 'needed' a college education. Times have changed for me. I have now invested in myself through both technical certifications and formal education.

**Current Education:**
- **BS-IT** (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) - Western Governors University
- **MBA-ITM** (Master of Business Administration in Information Technology Management) - Western Governors University  
- **Graduate Certificate in Project Management** - University of Maryland University College (UMUC)
- **Currently pursuing:** PSU Smeal eDBA Program

## Why Western Governors University

For years I have been referring friends, family and colleagues to enroll at Western Governors University (WGU) due to how much I enjoyed my experience and how much I gained from completing my degrees there. While I have attended multiple ground-based and online colleges, WGU truly rises to the top and deserves my undivided recommendation.

**What makes WGU unique:**
- **Competency-Based Learning**: Education based on demonstrating mastery, not time spent
- **Asynchronous Education**: Work at your own pace and schedule
- **Linear Course Progress**: Focus on one course at a time for deeper learning
- **Integration with Certifications**: College credits for industry certifications

**Learning Philosophy:**
I believe that education extends far beyond formal degrees. Every project, every challenge, and every interaction is an opportunity to learn and grow.

My educational approach emphasizes:
- Practical application of theoretical knowledge
- Collaborative learning and knowledge sharing
- Staying current with industry trends and best practices
- Developing both technical and leadership skills

*Education is not just about acquiring knowledge, but about developing the ability to think critically, solve problems, and adapt to change.*
