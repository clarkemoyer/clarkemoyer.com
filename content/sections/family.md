### Husband and Father

I am married to April Moyer and we have 2 children Autumn Moyer and Clarke S. Moyer. We focus on doing fun things around the house and saving for great vacations. For pictures and a better view of my family life send me a friend request on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ClarkeMoyer).

Our family values include respect, kindness, hard work, and the importance of education. We enjoy spending time together, whether it's traveling, exploring new places, or simply sharing meals and stories at home.

**Family Values:**
- Commitment to education and lifelong learning
- Supporting each other's dreams and aspirations
- Creating lasting memories through travel and experiences
- Maintaining strong relationships and connections

Family is at the heart of everything I do. I'm blessed to have a wonderful family that supports and inspires me every day.
