title: Charitable Involvement

Giving back to the community is a core value that guides my actions and decisions. I believe in using my skills and resources to make a positive impact on the lives of others.

## Free For Charity

I have been actively involved in direct and indirect charity projects for many years. Most notably I have founded and continue to fund a nonprofit that helps other nonprofits with IT, business, web, marketing, and other services at no cost called "Free For Charity".

Free For Charity is a 501c3 non profit that helps to educate other nonprofits and charity staff on IT, business and marketing topics. To learn more visit [freeforcharity.org](https://freeforcharity.org).

**Current Charitable Activities:**
- Supporting local educational initiatives
- Volunteering with technology mentorship programs
- Contributing to veteran support organizations
- Participating in community development projects
- Providing free IT and business consulting to nonprofits

**Philosophy:**
I believe that each of us has a responsibility to contribute to the greater good. Whether through direct service, financial support, or sharing knowledge and expertise, there are countless ways to make a difference.

My charitable work focuses particularly on education, technology access, and supporting those who have served our country.
